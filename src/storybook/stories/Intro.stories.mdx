# Vessna Wedding Storybook

All components created during development of this project with possible data inputs.

I found Storybook in 2018 and since that moment my life as developer was moved to the next level. Lot of capable frameworks, ton of integrations and great community support allow myself to be 100% front-end focused. 

Since there is no any rocket-science inside, and also because there are no any objections from customer, I decided to put this project to open-source. Mostly I use it as answer for a question like '_do you have some code to present_'.

This project is not in active development, but I support it and implement some new features when I have cool ideas and inspiration.

## Components Structure

* **Module** - Main components. Can include multiple promo inside and receive data both from page or storage.
* **Promo** - Logicless components. Can be part of any module and only receive data via props.
* **Atom** - Low-level components. Can be used everywhere.
* **Form** - All user input is handled via forms. Can send requests to server.

Other component groups like pages or popups are not presented here, you can check how they works on actual [website](https://vessna.wedding).
