# Vessna Wedding Storybook

All components created during development of this project.

Since there is no any rocket-science inside, and also because there are no any objection from customer, I decided to put this project to open-source.

## Components Structure

* **Module** - Main components. Can include multiple promo inside and receive data both from page or storage.
* **Promo** - Logicless components. Can be part of any module and only receive data via props.
* **Form** - All user input is handled via forms. Can send requests to server.
